# PDF Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with natural language generation. By leveraging external knowledge sources, such as PDFs, RAG models can provide accurate and contextually relevant responses based on the content of these documents. This approach is particularly useful in applications like chatbots, Q&A systems, and knowledge bases.
